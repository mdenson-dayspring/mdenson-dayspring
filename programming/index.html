    <li>HTML <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/" rel="nofollow">http://diveintohtml5.info/</a><br>
    <em>HTML is what you use to build a web page. With it you indicate what is the title, what is a paragraph, what is a link to another page, etc. The link is to a great book about HTML 5.</em></li>
    <li>CSS <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Style" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Style</a><br>
    <em>You use CSS to tell the browser how to display the different parts of the web page. Use bold text or italics, show the text as blue and on the right side of the page, etc. Using CSS you change you plain document into a slick brochure.</em></li>
    <li>Javascript <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/" rel="nofollow">http://eloquentjavascript.net/</a><br>
    <em>You use Javascript to make elements on the web page change or react to your mouse clicks or typing. You can make graphs and charts or make a game. Use Javascript to change your slick brochure into a user interface.</em></li>
    <li>PHP <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/php_tutorial_for_beginners/" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/php_tutorial_for_beginners/</a><br>
    <em>PHP is the easiest way to get your web site to save data for the next time or the next user. With PHP your game can now save your best score to brag to your friends. Using PHP you make your web page into an application.</em></li>

    <em>This language was first created in the 1960s. Now there are a number of direct descendants and a whole lot of languages that make use of ideas it pioneered. The link is to a book that you can’t get on-line for free. But, you can get it from the San Francisco Public Library online. (Ask a librarian how to access Safari Technical Reference Books. You should do that anyway. There are tons of books on various programming languages.)</em></li>

    <em>One of Lisp's direct decendents. It was used to build the original Yahoo Store and has been used to create other web sites.

    <em>Some people would probably scratch their head at why I put this here. It isn’t a “programming language” maybe, but the more I use it the more amazing it is to me. This is another one I use every day. The link is to a tutorial that includes everything you need to learn SQL. Once you have the idea you need to pick a database to dig more deeply.

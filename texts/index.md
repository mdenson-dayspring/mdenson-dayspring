## Our Father

Our Father in heaven,  
hallowed be your name,  
your kingdom come,  
your will be done,  
on earth as it is in heaven.  
Give us this day our daily bread.  
Forgive us our sins  
as we forgive those who sin against us.  
Lead us not into temptation  
but deliver us from evil.  
For thine is kingdom, and the power,  
and the glory now and forever.  
Amen.

## Confession

Almighty and most merciful Father,  
I have erred and strayed from thy ways like a lost sheep,  
I have followed too much the devices and desires of my own heart,  
I have offended against thy holy laws,  
I have left undone those things which I ought to have done,  
and I have done those things which I ought not to have done.  
But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon me,  
spare thou those who confess their faults,  
restore thou those who are penitent,  
according to thy promises declared unto mankind  
in Christ Jesus our Lord;  
and grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake,  
that I may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and sober life,  
to the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.

### or

Most merciful God,  
I confess that I have sinned against you  
in thought, word, and deed,  
by what I have done,  
and by what I have left undone.  
I have not loved you with my whole heart;  
I have not loved my neighbor as myself.  
I am truly sorry and I humbly repent.  
For the sake of your Son Jesus Christ,  
have mercy on me and forgive me;  
that I may delight in your will,  
and walk in your ways,  
to the glory of your Name. Amen.

## Creeds

### Apostle's Creed

{:.level0.hanging}
I believe in God, the Father almighty,  
maker of heaven and earth;

{:.level0.hanging}
And in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord;  
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,  
born of the Virgin Mary,  
suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
was crucified, dead, and buried.  
He descended into hell.  
The third day he rose again from the dead.  
He ascended into heaven,  
and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father almighty.  
From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

{:.level0.hanging}
I believe in the Holy Spirit,  
the holy catholic Church,  
the communion of saints,  
the forgiveness of sins,  
the resurrection of the body,  
and the life everlasting. Amen.

maker of heaven and earth,  
of all that is, seen and unseen.  

{:.level0.hanging.nospacing}
We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,  
the only Son of God,  
eternally begotten of the Father,

begotten, not made,  
of one being with the Father;  
through him all things were made.

He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,  
and his kingdom will have no end.

{:.level0.hanging.nospacing}
We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,  
who proceeds from the Father [and the Son],  
who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified,  
who has spoken through the prophets.  
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church.  
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins.  

{:.level1.hanging}
We look for the resurrection of the dead,  
and the life of the world to come. Amen.

<p>I returned to the Doctor today for my 3 week post op checkup.  All looks good (sorry for the pun.)</p>
<p>I've cracked the 20/30 line on the chart.  I was able to see two letters on that line with a little blinking and concentration.  The people in the office continue to use phrases like "that's great," "looks excellent," and other superlatives.  I can only assume that things are going very well.</p>
<p>I've been cleared to exercise, bike riding, walking, etc.  No lifting that "makes you grunt."  That's clear --  the sit ups will have to wait.  But, I will get to do some more activity.</p>
<p>I also asked about driving.  Dr. Carson said that legally my vision was good enough, but I should only drive in the best conditions.  That's fine, I haven't actually had any situations where not being able to drive was a huge problem.</p>
<p>My driver's license vision test is early next month.  Bad timing.  We will have to see what happens.  Might be a little awkward if I'm asked why I haven't driven for a month.  "Oh, I haven't trusted my vision, but I should be able to pass this vision test."</p>

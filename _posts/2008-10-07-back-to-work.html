<p>I started back at work yesterday (11 days after surgery).  Things went very well.  The biggest problem was that the part of my mind that I use for programming has gone soft.  I spent most of yesterday getting back going and only today do I feel like I am am starting to move forward.</p>
<p>As an aside, putting drops into my eyes every hour has given me a sense of how long an hour is?  Very short.  Everytime I look up it seems like it is time to put a drop in.  I am still missing them.</p>
<p>Today I went to lunch with my friend Matt and while I was at Yerba Buena Gardens without my glasses on I realized that in the middle distance I have very noticeable double vision.  Seems worst when looking across the street.  At that distance I am seeing two distinct images for each pedestrian or parking sign.</p>
<p>Covering my eyes it didn't seem to correct it.  It was noticably worse with just my right eye, though. Now with my glasses on I don't notice it.  That is a symptom of Kerataconus.  I will check up on this in the future.</p>

<p>Am I the only one who looks at a schematic and dreads seeing capacitors?  I don't know if it is really dread.  Maybe it is more disappointment.  It just seems like I always have to special purchase the capacitors, which puts a crimp in spur of the moment building.</p>
<p>When I first started building 3 or 4 years ago, the best purchase I made was not a piece of equipment but rather a $15 resistor pack from Radio Shack.  It is kind of ironic.  But it really was.  I have not had to special purchase a resistor for a project (except for 1% or higher power ratings) since then.  The pack includes at least five of every 5% value 1/4 watt resistor.</p>
<p>But for capacitors, I also purchased the Radio Shack disc and electrolytic packs.  These have been helpful, but because they are a mix and match bunch of values the ability to find what I need is much more hit-or -miss (maybe better said miss-or-hit to represent the frequency.)</p>
<p>Is it not possible to get a pack of capacitors that contain every value?  I think there is also the matter of different types: ceramic discs, metal film, poly, mylar, mica, and on and on.</p>
<p>Then there is the issue of variable components.  If I need a potentiomater I can still go to Radio Shack, but a variable capacitor, HAH!  Better start looking at my catalogs.</p>
<p>Has anybody had a similar experience?  Or is there a good capacitor pack that would help me out?  How about an electronics parts store within striking distance of San Francisco?</p>
<p>Sigh!</p>

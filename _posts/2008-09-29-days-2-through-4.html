<p>Today is Monday.  It has been 3 days since my last post.</p>
<p>On Friday (the day after the procedure) I went to Dr. Goodman's office first thing in the morning.  The bandage was taken off my eye, and I was asked to read the chart.  I was able to read some of the letters (with work) down to the 20-60 line plus one more letter.  Wow! My vision in the left eye is already better than it was the day before corrected with glasses.  I was given a regimen of eye drops.  vigamox (an anti biotic) and Pred Forte (an anti inflammatory) 4 times a day (8, noon, 4, and 8 ) and celluvisc (a lubricant) every hour.  The first dose was given and I got a sense of how fragile my ey was when the O.D. wiped my eye with a tissue.  He was so gentle I barely felt the tissue.</p>
<p>The rest of Friday I slept and still was a little groggy.  My eye though feels pretty good when I keep the eye drops in.  I can tell when it is time to put in a lubricating drop, but even then it is not pain by any means.</p>
<p>Saturday, I was over the General anesthesia.  I was able to stay up all day. This made getting the drops in on time much easier and my eye feels great.</p>
<p>Sunday, I made it to church in the morning.  I was not terribly tired.  I realized that I hadn't focused past a few feet for a couple days, and looking any distance was tiring but not painful.  Not much to report about my eyes.  I am still not reading.  I have The Lord of the Rings and CD and our reading from the Bible about the Eucharist on CD as well.</p>
<p>Today has been more of the same.  I don't know what is meant by sensitivity to light.  My eyes are a little sensitive when I am outdoors, but I don't have any problems in doors at all.   The eye shades I was given have worked for all but the most direct sunlight.  The white part of my eye is a little red but mainly it looks like a bad allergy day.</p>
<p>Actually the most annoying part has been the eye shield.  I am supposed to tape it on each night to keep from jostling the eye in bed.  Each morning I take off the shield and have an ugly rash where it touches the skin.  (I used a gauze pad under the edges of the shield last night and that helped some.  The other problem is that I am supposed to tape it on, but the tape won't stick to my beard.  I am not actually sure how much good it is doing.  I am going to try a strap of some kind (like a real pirate's eye patch to hold the shield if I can find one.  Halloween is coming up.  I should be able to find something. hi hi.</p>

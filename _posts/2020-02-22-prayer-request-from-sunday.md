Today I received an email from Sunday Agang, requesting prayer and support for the seminary in Jos that he serves as Provost.  I am glad to count Sunday as a friend, and I have a heart for his ministry in Nigeria.

I've copied his letter into this page so that I can share it with others easily.  Please feel free to share the link to this page with others who would also pray for Sunday and the church in Nigeria.

> Dear JETS Gospel Partners,
>
> I bring you greetings in our Lord's gracious name. Many thanks for all of your help in raising funds for the persecuted church across the globle. I am writing to introduce myself as the new Provost of ECWA Theological Seminary, Jos (JETS). I took over from Prof. Randee O. Ijatuyi-Morphe in January 2020. 
>
> As you may be aware, JETS is right at the heart of the region where Christians have been discriminated against and persecuted.  The entire Middle Belt is a region where the different Christian denominations are under attack today than ever. JETS is an institution that provides theological education that a persecuted church needs to stand the test of a trying time like the one Christians in Northern Nigeria are facing. 
>
> Such an institution needs all the support it can get to continue to train Christians across Nigeria and beyond to stand firm in the Lord.
>
> It is in view of this fact that I am writing to share with you some of our challenges:
>
> 1. Our students are studying under a very deplorable class and accommodation conditions. We have a population of students of 1500. Most of them are coming from the Middle Belt, North East and North West where the Boko Haram and Herdsmen are the strongest. Some of them are displaced and traumatized people. Yet, they have an unquenchable thirst for the Word of God. However, they cannot afford to pay school tuition or fees. As a result, the institution is Management is not able to provide them with benefiting learning facilities. Currently, some of our students have to stand while receiving a 3 credit hour lecture. To solve this problem, we need to provide 300 classroom seats. Each study seat will cost $67 US Dollars.
>
> 2. To connect our students to good theological materials around the world, the library needs to be automated. We will need $28, 000 to automate the library. The library roof also needs to be reroofed because it is linking.
>
> 3. In spite of the persecution, there is an increase in the number of people who want to be taught the Word of God or be prepared for the ministry of the Word in hard times. Some of the students are from displaced communities. They cannot afford to pay for accommodation outside the institution. Yet, we cannot provide them with accommodation because we have an accommodation shortage. Even the ones we have are deplorable. For instance, in one of our deplorable hostels, we have 30 students using only one toilet and a bathroom. We will need $70, 000.00 to be able to renovate the hostels and made them conducive for habitation.
>
> Kindly feel free to send this need to your friends who may be interested in helping us to get these need met to provide a refuge for the persecuted Christians who need shelter and a place to study the Word for life and ministry.
>
> Warmly,  
Rev. Sunday B. Agang, PhD  
Provost, ECWA Theological Seminary, Jos

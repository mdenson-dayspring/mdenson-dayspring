<p>Today I reached a milestone.</p>
<p>In June I started swimming again after 19 years out of the pool.  In high school I had been an above average swimmer on my schools swim team.  But that all ended when I left for college.  Over the years my weight has balooned and I was in pretty awful shape.</p>
<p>Then in June I started swimming.  My family went with a few other families to a water park out in the sun of the East Bay.  The park had a swimming pool with a lane set aside for lap swimming, so I jumped in and did a few lengths.  That got the bug in me.  I went and bought goggles and got into a public pool the next week.</p>
<p>Oh, the agony.  I swam maybe 600 yards and was nearly physically ill on the drive home.  Just shows what 19 years out of the pool will do to you.  So I set my sights on getting my yardage up.  Specifically I wanted to swim twice a week and get up to 2,000 yards a session by the end of September.</p>
<p>I actually did pretty well at the two times a week.  Better than I expected.  I still am often very tired when I get out.  No hopping out of the pool like I used to.</p>
<p>Well after 3 months, I swam 2,000 yards today.   And, I didn't feel half bad after getting out.</p>
<p>Now I will have some surgery (that will be another post) and hope that I can get back in the water in a few months.  In the meantime I'll concentrate on shedding some weight.</p>
<p>But I'm happy with where I've gotten.  I am in much better shape even now for my surgery, and hopefully it will help in recovering quickly.</p>

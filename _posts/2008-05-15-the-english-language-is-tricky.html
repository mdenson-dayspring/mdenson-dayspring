<p>I am a bit of a word freak.  Not to the point of being an avid Scrabble player or anything, but I do find the English language fascinating.  So I subscribe to the dictionary.com word of the day email.  It is always a good diversion for a minute or so.</p>
<p>Well today's word was paean as in</p>
<blockquote><p>paean \PEE-uhn\, noun:<br />
1. A joyous song of praise, triumph, or thanksgiving.<br />
2. An expression of praise or joy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Having never actually used this word I was started that it is very close to a homophone for peon as in</p>
<blockquote><p>pe·on1 \pee-uhn, pee-on\, noun:<br />
1. (in Spanish America) a farm worker or unskilled laborer; day laborer.<br />
2. (formerly, esp. in Mexico) a person held in servitude to work off debts or other obligations.<br />
3. any person of low social status, esp. one who does work regarded as menial or unskilled; drudge.</p></blockquote>
<p>The emphasis is the only difference.  Make sure you get it right!</p>

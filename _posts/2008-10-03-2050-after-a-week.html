<p>On Wednesday, I had an appointment with Dr. Goodman.  We started by reading the chart with my left eye.  I was able to read another line.  So the eye has improved to 20/50.  Dr. Goodman looked at the eye and said everything look "excellent."</p>
<p>He found a "fiber" in my eye and removed it with tweezers/forceps. To be honest it was good that it happened.  It has reduced my eeriness about having the sutures removed in 12 months.  He put numbing drops in my eye and I felt nothing.</p>
<p>My next appointment is in two weeks, and I will be returning to Dr. Chong for a new prescription sometime in the fall.</p>
<p>I also plan to go to work on Monday.  I will need to be mindfull to make sure I do not overdo it.</p>
<p>Otherwise it has been pretty uneventful.  I call that a good thing.</p>

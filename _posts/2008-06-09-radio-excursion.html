<p>Sunday I took the K2 for an "excursion".  About 20 feet to be exact, into the beautiful outdoors.</p>
<p>The reason was to get on 30 meters.  Matt (KK6CB) and I made a sked for some cross town cw at 10110MHz.  Since my rooftop antenna won't load up on 30m I needed to set up my homebrew field vertical.  And since I didn't have coax long enough to reach my shack I moved the shack outdoors.  It was a fun afternoon.</p>
<p>The single handed antenna set up worked great.  Unfortunately, Matt and I weren't able to work each other very well on 30m.  Matt wasn't able to hear my QRP signal.  He was running 50 watts though, which made him workable at my end.</p>
<p>So we chatted for a little while on the local 2m repeater instead.  So in the end it wasn't actually a loss.  I got to talk radio and play radio.</p>
<p>Here are some photos.</p>

I am not a early morning person. I am not a morning
person at all really.

Consistent daily patterns basically start when I arrive at work.
Before that, I hae never been good about doing the same thing every
day. (That is why I have a beard.)

That said, I wanted to write down what I am trying to do most mornings
right now. I say most mornings, because I am not beating myself up when
this doesn't happen on a particular day, but I am evaluating every week
or so to make sure it is happening consistently and hopefully more regularly.
If not, it is normally an issue with the night before and so I will try
a change in the evenings.

### Setup

I want to wake up on my own without an alarm. If I do an it is between 6:00
and 6:30 then I get up.

Then I make my cup of coffee and sit down with my reading Bible.

Here is the pattern I am trying for the moment. Thanks to Matthew Everhard for
the outline of this.

### LP

Recite the Lord's Prayer.

### CN

More extended confession This is either reading a prayer from the Book of
Common Worship (PCUSA) or extemporaneous if there is a particular sin I
know needs to be confessed or if I recently heard a sermon that calls for
specific confession.

### Bible

I have been using the [Horner Reading](/assets/professor-grant-horners-bible-reading-system.pdf) 
plan for my daily readings. This is a plan that has 10 chapters a day from 10 places in the Bible. 
I should write about this sometime separately. For now it is sufficient to say that this normally 
takes 45 - 50 minutes and includes readings from the gospels, pentateuch, history, wisdom, psalms, 
epistles, and Acts. This is just what I have found helpful. It could just be a chapter from Old 
and New Testement.

### AC

Recite a creed. I pick one or both of the Apostle's and Nicene Creed.

### DX

Sing a doxology. Either _Gloria Patri_ or _Doxology_. I may expand this to other
doxologies as I come across them in my Bible reading, but I have these two
memorized and I find them reorienting.

### Summary

That's it. I assume there are other times for prayer and Bible study that will
take place in the rest of the day depending on what is going on. Am I preparing
for a sermon or reflection, or am I meeting with a friend, etc.

This time is meant to be a foundation, not the whole of my time spent in
scripture. I had just been doing the reading, which is most of the time
spent, but I've found the the prayers and creeds before and after have
helped me with mental orientation.

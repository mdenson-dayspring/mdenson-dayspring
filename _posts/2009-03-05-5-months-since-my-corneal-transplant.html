<p>It has been three months since I last wrote about my eye.   That indicates how little I am aware of it.</p>
<p>I am able to go for a week or so without explicitly thinking about my eye.  Really the most I think about it is related to remembering when I have doctor's appointments up coming or when allergies make my eyes itch.</p>
<p><strong>Two months ago</strong> (three months after the surgery) I had a followup doctor appointment.  I was told to let the Vigamox (antibiotic) run out and then stop taking it.  I also started taking the Predforte twice a day (morning and evening).</p>
<p><strong>One month ago</strong> (four months after the surgery) at my last appointment, the doctor cut the Predforte down to a single drop a day.  Since I was still having no allergy problems with my left eye, I asked about getting something for my other eye.    Dr. Goodman prescribed another drop (Alrex - a diluted version of Predforte) for my right eye, two drops a day.</p>
<p>Since then, the right eye is better.  The left eye is also starting to itch some now.  I assume that is just allergies.  If it is still going on I'll mention it at my next appointment, but it really isn't bad.</p>
<p>I also learned one unexpected thing last week.  I had been a blood donor before the surgery, and I scheduled a donation.   I called the blood bank the day before and found that a corneal transplant is a "permanent deferral."   That means I won't be able donate blood again, unless they change their rules.  I hadn't expected that.</p>

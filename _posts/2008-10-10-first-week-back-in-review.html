<p>Well,  I've finished a week back at work.  I think I am getting back into the flow of things.</p>
<p>I can truthfully say that I have not felt my eye for large portions of the last few day.  I really can't believe how quickly my eye is healing.  I am still not supposed to excercise yet.  I hope that that will end at my next doctor appointment next week.</p>
<p>I can't wait to get some new glasses.  I am very hopeful about how I will see with new glasses.  I am hoping that I will be able to schedule an appointment with Dr. Chong after my appointment with Dr. Goodman.</p>

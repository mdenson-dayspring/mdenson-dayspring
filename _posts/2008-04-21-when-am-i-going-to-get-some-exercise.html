<p>Matt made a new post on his blog <a href="http://runnersjourney.typepad.com/rj/2008/04/how-to-run-32-b.html">Runner's Journey</a> this weekend that got me wondering (again) what I am going to do about getting some exercise.</p>
<p>The last time I ran was 5 or 6 years ago.  At that time I had the urge to lose some weight and try to feel better.  I did pretty well.  I lost about 20 lbs and was able to run around my local lake (Lake Merced: 4-5 miles).  Then, I had a surgery which made running uncomfortable for a few months and I've never gotten back out since.</p>
<p>If Matt keeps it up, I may find myself out on a run some chilly morning.  Keep it up Matt.</p>
